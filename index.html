          Hi, I’m Thomas Oide. Thanks for stopping by my portfolio.
        </p>
        <p>
          I currently live in Minneapolis and work as a designer/developer at The Star Tribune, where I build standalone interactives, internal tools and graphics for some of our biggest projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a degree in data journalism as well as minors in computer science and information technology from the University of Missouri. I consider myself a digital Swiss Army knife — I can build graphics with D3, create databases and APIs using Django, Python and PostgreSQL, design front-end experiences with Javascript and Svelte and conduct data analysis using R.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though I have technical skills, I came up through the journalism ranks as a reporter. I worked for two-and-a-half years at The Davis Enterprise, interned twice at The Sacramento Bee and was also a summer intern at The Boston Globe. That gave me a fundamental understanding of reporting and storytelling, which is still what drives the work I do and the code I write everyday.
        </p>

          Take a peek at my Github for code examples, take a look at my Twitter (if you dare, I’m just a sad sports fan on there) or reach out to me via email at thomas.t.oide@gmail.com if you have a question or want to build something together.
