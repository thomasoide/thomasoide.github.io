          Hi, I’m Thomas. Thanks for stopping by my portfolio.
        </p>
        <p>
          I currently live in California and work at Axios, where I create data visualizations and build newsroom tools to help streamline workflows. I previously worked at the Minneapolis Star Tribune, where I built standalone interactives, internal tools and graphics for some of its biggest projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a degree in data journalism as well as minors in computer science and information technology from the University of Missouri. I consider myself a bit of a Swiss Army knife — I can build graphics and design front-end experiences with D3 and Svelte, develop backends using Django, Python and PostgreSQL and conduct data analysis using R.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though I have technical skills, I started out in journalism as a reporter. I worked for two-and-a-half years at The Davis Enterprise, interned twice at The Sacramento Bee and was also a reporting intern at The Boston Globe. That gave me a fundamental understanding of storytelling, which is still what drives the work I do and the things I build everyday.
