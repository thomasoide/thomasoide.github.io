                I'm currently a designer and developer on the Star Tribune's digital design team, doing a combination of page design, data visualization and full-stack engineering for news products.
                I do most of my work with Python, Javascript and HTML/CSS, but am free to experiment with different languages and packages in this role.
                I believe in flexible solutions and using the language/stack that best suits the problem in front of me, especially when journalistic problems are almost never the same.

                I'm one of the developers on a three-person team responsible for reengineering and redesigning The Houston Chronicle's Right to Know Network, a website hosting EPA databases tracking toxic and flammable chemicals at factories across the country.
                I'm mostly working on writing server-side code, completely reengineering the ETL process, but I'm also working on front-end development and UX design.

                I spent the 2018-2019 school year working for the Columbia Missourian, first as a state government reporter and then as a graphic designer. I also spent the spring of 2017 covering higher education.
              </p>
              <p>
                I've focused most of this year on applying my development and coding skills to journalism. I analyzed a decade of school suspension data in Missouri that led to <a class="link" href="https://www.columbiamissourian.com/news/k12_education/disparities-in-suspensions-stack-the-odds-against-missouri-s-black/article_8acaadc0-0470-11e9-b0c6-d798ac90697f.html">this story.</a>
                I also built <a class="link" href="https://n5iu4pwcrb.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/schools">this accompanying search tool</a> using the Python web framework Django so that our readers could explore the data for themselves.
              </p>
              <p>
                On the graphics desk this spring, I built <a class="link" href="https://observablehq.com/@thomasoide/missouris-chlorinated-small-water-systems">this map</a> using D3 and Observable to give statewide context for a story about aging water systems in Missouri.
                I also used code to streamline one of our workflows: A graphic that shows where a bill is in the legislative process. I built <a class="link" href="https://observablehq.com/@thomasoide/missouri-legislature-house-bill-process">two Observable notebooks</a> so that reporters could not only create the graphic, but also customize the headline and summary of the graphic so that readers could have context about what the bill would do if passed.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also spent the spring of 2018 working on a searchable salary database web application (<a class="link" href="https://github.com/thomasoide/salary_proj">source code</a>), using the Express Node.js framework and MySQL.

                In the summer of 2018, I was a metro reporting intern at The Boston Globe. I wrote a mixture of daily stories with features that took a few days to report.

                I spent the summers after my freshman and sophomore years at The Sacramento Bee, my hometown paper.
                I spent the summer of 2017 on the Real-Time desk as a hybrid copy editor/night editor/digital producer.
                The Real-Time desk was my first exposure to using analytics with journalism: I was tasked with writing quick posts on trending topics to generate page views for the website. That summer, I generated over 700,000 page views for the site.

                The summer before that, I was a metro reporting intern. Here are some of my highlights from that summer:
